# How to use the `TO-DO List` planner application?

:arrow_right: The application is intended to help you manage your daily tasks and keep track of them.

:arrow_right: You have the option to create multiple lists with different purposes which can store individual tasks as well. You can edit the lists' names if needed, and delete them as well.

:arrow_right: Once you create a list and you click on it, you'll have the possibility to create tasks by clicking the plus icon. Then, you'll be promted with a form requiring the name of the task and some additional but not mandatory properties such as due date/time, priority (the default is `no priority`, the task is marked with green), and description. 

:arrow_right: If you choose a due date and time for your task, you'll be notified prior the deadline by 15 minutes. If you do not complete the task in time, it will be marked as overdue.

:arrow_right: You can edit the task by clicking on the pen icon.

:arrow_right: To mark a task as done, just click on it and it will be hashed.

:arrow_right: You can filter your tasks using the `All`, `Complete` or `Incomplete` to show only the complete/incomplete ones, or you can keep them all on the screen.

:arrow_right: Use the `Search tasks` bar to search through your tasks. You can choose to search by task name or task description.

:arrow_right: In the upper right corner, there is a counter telling you how many tasks you have left to complete.

:arrow_right: The application is responsive.

:arrow_right: If you don't have any lists/tasks created, Pusheen will be watching you :eyes:.
